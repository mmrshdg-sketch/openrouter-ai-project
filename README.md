Hey! this project was made using ai! i hope you enjoy it!

This is just a overlay for openrouter's api service. all you need to do is sign up, and generate your api.

After that, you just open the python file and replace "YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY_HERE" with whatever you api key is.

Then, the file will give you a local link where the project is being hosted at.

IMPORTANT NOTE: PLEASE LOOK AT REQUIRMENTS.TXT AND INSTALL BOTH DEPENDENCIES USING PIP OR PIP3 (eg, pip/pip3 install example) .

I hope you enjoy!# openrouter-ai-project
